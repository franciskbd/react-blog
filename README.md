# MY React app
<p>this project is a blog which tells about kweku ananse "spider" Stories which is
very familiar with kids. in this project showed me how key value pairs can be
passed from parent to child ie props. and also mapped over them with .map
the .map method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for
every array element this method calls the provided function once for each element
in an array, in order.</p>
